# General Information and Acknowledgment
I learned React while simultaneously working on this project, and I had great time being challenged
and writing code and debugging. I have Used The YouTube channels Evangadi Tech and GreatStack for some
files and assistances during coding and when I hit the wall while working I have tweaked some by refactoring,
and https://www.Reactjs.org for documentation and learning some react hooks that I have not previously worked 
with while learning, I have also used some YouTube channels like Bro Code, Net Ninja and The Web School 
for some quick explanation for some concepts. I have used https://www.themoviedb.org for data fetching, and 
https://www.firebase.google.com for user authentication and database services, I have used the challenge based approach to solving coding problems.
